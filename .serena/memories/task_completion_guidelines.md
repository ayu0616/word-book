## Task Completion Guidelines

When a task is completed, the following steps should be taken to ensure code quality and project stability:

1.  **Run Tests:** Execute `bun test` to ensure all tests pass and no regressions have been introduced.
2.  **Type Check:** Run `bun typecheck` to verify type safety.
3.  **Lint Code:** Run `bun lint` to check for linting errors and adherence to code style.
4.  **Format Code:** Run `bun format` to automatically format the code according to project conventions.
5.  **Review Changes:** Carefully review all changes before committing to ensure they meet the requirements and maintain code quality.
6.  **Commit Changes:** Commit changes with a clear and concise commit message, following the project's commit message conventions (if any).
